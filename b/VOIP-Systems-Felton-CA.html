<p>Database Systems Corp Nevertheless, today the diversity of office phone systems for small business is substantial and are based upon different innovation platforms. More than a third of businesses now use VoIP as their go-to system. A hosted system offers all PBX services, applications and features, and it preserves software in the cloud rather than on a server like digital systems. By bringing movies, television, video brochures, remote CD-ROMs, business LANs and the Internet into houses and small companies, DSL could make these markets viable for telephone companies and application providers alike.</p>
